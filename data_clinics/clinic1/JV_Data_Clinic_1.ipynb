This is the essence of this course and of the skills you should try build for yourself: Many people can run fancy models these days but not many people can interpret the results correctly.

With higher education facing severe budget cuts, the government is looking for creative solutions to \"do more with less.\" Convinced by the stunning progress in language modeling, officials believe LLMs could help battle growing teacher shortages and reduce costs by automating parts of the education process. Your job description: investigate which LMs might be best suited to plug the gaps without draining the budget!\n",

This famous dataset consists of 57 subjects with multiple-choice questions, covering diverse subjects like mathematics, computer science, history, and law. Most providers of state-of-the-art LMs use this dataset to showcase the versatility of their latest models. Unfortunately, the intern responsible for collecting the results, didn‚Äôt pay attention during DACS KEN3450: Data Analysis. As a result, the collected datasets are slightly corrupted. Jammer!\n",

    "### A very brief primer on Language Models\n",
    "We studied LLMs in the context of the NLP course but here is a short reminder. Language models (LMs) are sophisticated statistical models designed to understand and generate human-like text. At their core, LMs are trained to predict the most likely continuation of a given input text. For example, given the input \"The cat sat on the,\" an LM might predict \"mat\" as a likely continuation.\n",
    "LMs are trained on vast text samples from various sources, including books, websites, and social media. This extensive training allows them to capture patterns and relationships in language, enabling them to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text across a wide range of topics and styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "While LMs can produce text that appears to be written by intelligent humans, it's important to note that their capabilities can diverge from human intelligence in unexpected ways. They may sometimes generate factually incorrect information or struggle with complex reasoning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two key concepts in understanding LMs are:\n",
    "1. **Tokens**: LMs process text using \"tokens\" rather than individual characters. Tokens can be words, parts of words, or punctuation marks. For example, the sentence \"I love AI!\" might be tokenized as [\"I\", \"love\", \"AI\", \"!\"]. Tokenization is the first step in both training and using an LM.\n",
    "2. **Context**: The input text provided to an LM is called the \"context.\" This context informs the model's predictions or generations. A longer or more specific context often leads to more accurate and relevant outputs.\n",

    "B. /Discuss:/ First of all, the shocking thing is that we would expect to have 4 possible different answers for each question, but in fact, we have quite a lot. For example, for df_z there are 560 different answers. Another point is that some answers are indeed supposed to refer to A, B, C, or D, that is, one of the 4 possible choices, however, they were written in different ways, such as 'Answer:A' 'Not wrong, Not wrong, so the answer is D' (probably due to the back and forth in the chat where it previously considered other options), 'Not sure' (which is not even supposed to be an answer, since in this test, they should pick an option), 'Vitamin B12, so the answer is C' (where the model basically gives a reason alongside its answer, but it at least picks one).\n",

    "C. /Discuss:/ After all the filtering that was done, quite a few samples were removed. This can be problematic because it can change the original distribution of the data, and herefore, bias the results. For example, we see that for df_x, 3.21% of the answers were removed, which might not seem like much, but it's 446 samples. For the case of df_z, 8.4% of the samples were removed, and this corresponds to 1170 samples, which is quite signficant. Besides, by doing a better filtering, I am pretty sure we could capture the which answer the model was trying to give (essentially extract the A, B, C, or D), which would have prevented us from removing so many samples.\n",
    "Besides, even the ones where this is not possible at all, which happens in cases where the model does not pick any of the four possible choices, would be nice to have in our analysis and see things like: what is the percentage of the answers where the model does not pick any of the answers? This could also reveal some information about the problem and the performance of these language models."
